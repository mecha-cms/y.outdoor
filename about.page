A classic template designed by [StyleShout](https://www.styleshout.com/legacy-templates). The first time I found it on the [BTemplates](https://btemplates.com/2008/blogger-template-outdoor) website around 2009 when I was in high school. I immediately fell in love with it and used it on my personal blog. This template means something to me. I want to preserve my childhood memories through this project.
